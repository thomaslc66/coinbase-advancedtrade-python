Here's an example of how to use the package: 
````python
 from coinbase_advanced_trader import coinbase_client
 from coinbase_advanced_trader.coinbase_client import Side

 # Set your API key and secret
 API_KEY = "your_api_key"
 API_SECRET = "your_api_secret"

 # Set the credentials
 coinbase_client.set_credentials(API_KEY, API_SECRET)


 def buy_bitcoin(amount, currency="USD", price=None):
     product_id = f"BTC-{currency}"

     if price:
         order_type = "limit_limit_gtc"
         order_configuration = {
             order_type: {
                 "base_size": str(amount),
                 "limit_price": str(price)
             }
         }
     else:
         order_type = "market_market_ioc"
         order_configuration = {
             order_type: {
                 "quote_size": str(amount),
             }
         }

     client_order_id = coinbase_client.generate_client_order_id()
     side = Side.BUY.name

     response = coinbase_client.createOrder(
         client_order_id=client_order_id,
         product_id=product_id,
         side=side,
         order_configuration=order_configuration
     )

     return response


 amount_to_buy = 0.001
 currency = "USD"

 # You can specify a price for a limit order, or leave it as None for a market order
 price = 10000

 response = buy_bitcoin(amount_to_buy, currency, price)
 print("Buy order response:", response)
````
